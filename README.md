This is a repository of code associated with a traffic simulation of the Nagelâ€“Schreckenberg model written between June 2015 - August 2016.
sim.c is the main simulation code, and chi.c is an analysis code to compare one of the output files from sim.c to the Poisson distribution.
The .out files are example output files from these programs.
